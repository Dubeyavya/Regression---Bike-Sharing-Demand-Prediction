#### Bike Sharing Demand Prediction ####


**Overview**

This project is part of my full-stack Data Science and AI course at Almabetter, conducted under the mentorship of Shivam Dutta, co-founder, and CEO of Almabetter. The capstone project focuses on investigating and predicting bike-sharing demand using a dataset containing temporal, meteorological, and categorical information.

**Problem Statement**

The goal is to explore relationships between factors such as date, temperature, humidity, and categorical variables like seasons and holidays. The objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts rented bike counts. This predictive model can aid in optimizing service planning, resource allocation, and enhancing user experience for the bike-sharing service.

**Features and Selection**

The selected features crucial for predicting bike-sharing demand are:

Hour

Temperature(Â°C)

Solar Radiation (MJ/m2)

Feature ranking indicates the importance of each feature in the prediction model. Notably, 'Hour,' 'Rainfall(mm),' 'Snowfall (cm),' 'Holiday,' and 'Functioning Day' were identified as the most influential features.

**Data Science Lifecycle**

The project encompasses various stages of the data science lifecycle:

**Data Understanding and Wrangling:** Comprehensive exploration of the dataset.

**Data Visualization and Storytelling:** Creation of 15 charts to understand relationships between variables.

**Hypothesis Testing:** Formulation and testing of three hypothetical statements.

**Feature Engineering:** Development of additional features to enhance model performance.

**Data Preprocessing:** Ensuring the dataset is optimized for machine learning models.

**Machine Learning Models**

The project involved implementing three machine learning models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regression

Gradient Boosting Regression

Each model's performance was evaluated using key metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared Score.

**Conclusion**

The successful completion of this project demonstrates proficiency in various data science techniques, from exploratory data analysis to machine learning model implementation. The insights gained contribute to the broader goal of optimizing bike-sharing services for improved resource management and user experience.
